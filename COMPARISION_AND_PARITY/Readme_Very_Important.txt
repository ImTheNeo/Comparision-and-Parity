Please do not forget to hex file in proteus each time when you open the protous
I dont know why it is not saving the hex file.
hex file is at /lab2_first/lab2_first/Debug/lab2_first.hex

"Sometimes", My proteus file for comparision and parity only working in my device
at a specific folder in documents. 
I do not understand why. I can show everyting while im giving demo.
While you are reading my prework i can also show everyting on skype hocam.
